# freeCodeCampProjects

freeCodeCamp is a non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone.

FCC enabled me to brush up on web development skills such as:
- HTML & CSS
- Javascript
- React
- Redux

So far I have earned the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.
